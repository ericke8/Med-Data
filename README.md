# Med-Data

Med-Data is a mobile app that allows users to enter a list of medications in their household, from prescription drugs to over-the-counter. Whenever the name of their medication matches with an FDA drug recall, the user will be alerted immediately. Additionally, there is a real-time news feed that also brings food recalls to the user’s attention.

The goal of this app is to optimize the flow of crucial information by creating a platform that brings important information to the public. Knowledge is power, and we want to give users quick and convenient access to the information they deserve to know. The users’ safety is of our utmost concern, which is why we want to enable them to make informed decisions about what they put into their body, and prevent the amount of people who are unnecessarily exposed to contaminants in food or drugs. 

Our app was coded using Android Studio. A large part of our app was also implementing the usage of Google Cloud. We used Firebase authentication to store user login information. Additionally, we utilized the Firebase database to store each user and what medications they are taking. Users also have the ability to add or remove medications from the database as they stop or start taking them.

The data displayed in Med-Data is taken through openFDA, which is the Food and Drug Administration’s API. Different queries are made to parse food and drug recall data using JSON.
